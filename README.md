# Weather App

This week project was ambitious; the end goal was to create a weather app using JavaScript fetch, APIÂ´s and a lot of styling.

## The problem

I will say the firt challenge came on fetching correctly the information and "breaking it down", analyzing how to get the correct information displayed in our app. I also struggle with CSS, for me that was one of the biggest challenges this week.
I have more time, I will add the Geolocalization feature and work more in the styling.
